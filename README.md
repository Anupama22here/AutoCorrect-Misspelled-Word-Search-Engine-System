## DESCRIPTION
  This project is an AutoCorrect System designed to identify and correct misspelled words. Using a pre-trained model, the system analyzes the input word, generates possible edits (like deleting, swapping, or replacing letters), and suggests the most likely correct spelling based on a large corpus of known words and their probabilities. The project integrates these functionalities into a user-friendly interface, making it easy to check and correct spelling errors.

## WORKING
  Intially a text document has been uploaded to make the model get trained from it.

### 1. split(word): 
This function takes a word and splits it into all possible pairs of prefixes and suffixes. For example, for the word "hello", it will generate [('', 'hello'), ('h', 'ello'), ('he', 'llo'), ('hel', 'lo'), ('hell', 'o'), ('hello', '')]. This splitting is used in generating potential edits for the word.
### 2. delete(word): 
This function generates possible words that result from deleting one letter from the input word. For instance, if the input is "hello", it would generate ['ello', 'hllo', 'helo', 'helo', 'hell']. This simulates a common spelling mistake where a letter is accidentally omitted.
### 3. swap(word):
This function creates a list of words that result from swapping two adjacent letters in the input word. For example, "hello" might produce ['ehllo', 'hlelo', 'hello', 'helol']. This helps catch errors where two letters are accidentally switched.
### 4. replace(word): 
This function generates a list of words that result from replacing each letter in the word with every letter in the alphabet. For example, "cat" might produce words like ['aat', 'bat', 'cat', ... 'zat']. This covers spelling mistakes where a wrong letter is used.
### 5. insert(word): 
This function generates new words by inserting every letter of the alphabet at every position in the input word. For example, for "cat", it could generate ['acat', 'bcat', ... 'zcat', 'caat', ... 'cazt']. This accounts for mistakes where an extra letter might have been inserted.
### 6. level_one_edits(word): 
This function combines the outputs of delete, swap, replace, and insert functions to create all possible "one-edit-away" words from the input. It returns a set of these words, which represents all possible words that are just one change away from the input.
### 7. level_two_edits(word): 
This function takes the one-edit-away words generated by level_one_edits and applies level_one_edits to each of them again. It returns a set of all possible words that are two changes away from the original word. This is useful for catching more complex spelling errors.
### 8. spelling_check(word, unique_read, probability): 
This is the main function that checks the spelling of the input word. It first checks if the word is already correct by seeing if it exists in unique_read (a set of known words). If not, it generates a list of suggestions by finding words that are one or two edits away. It then filters these suggestions to find those that are in unique_read and returns them along with their probabilities, which indicate how likely they are to be the correct word.
